=====================
Django-StaticMediaMgr
=====================

**New in this version:** Ability to combine multiple files into a new file before copying and/or compressing them.

This app provides a way to copy and consolidate static media files to one or more configured locations. This is incredibly helpful if you have your media served from another server.

It consists of a management command, ``copy_static_media``, and several settings including:

* ``STATIC_MEDIA_COPY_PATHS``  A tuple of dictionaries specifying the from/to for copying files.

* ``STATIC_MEDIA_PURGE_OLD_FILES``  Should old files be purged from the destination directory.

* ``STATIC_MEDIA_COMPRESS_CSS``  Should CSS files be compressed during copy using the included port of `YUI Compressor <http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/>`_ 

* ``STATIC_MEDIA_COMPRESS_JS``  Should javascript files be compressed during copy using the included python port of Douglas Crockford's `jsmin <http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html>`_

* ``STATIC_MEDIA_APP_MEDIA_PATH``  Where (and if) should the application media be copied to automatically.

* ``STATIC_MEDIA_FILE_COMBINATIONS`` Configuration of combining multiple files into one.


TODO
====

* Allow lossless image compression for pngs, gifs and jpegs using external tools like optiPNG.

* Create a template tag to minify inline CSS and javascript with caching
